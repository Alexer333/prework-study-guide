# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is my first coded webpage. My motivation was to get a bit of a headstart on coding, and to learn how to put this together. I built this as a base for my future. To get started on what I want to learn. And it helped me learn some of the basics of coding and how some languages work.

## Usage

This webpage simply shows off a few uses of several coding languages, and as an added bonus you can use the console to see javascript running! There's not really much else to the usage of this website, as it's pretty simple. Just a showcase of different languages and what a starter site is like.
